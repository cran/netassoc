Description: Infers species associations from community matrices. Uses local and (optional) regional-scale co-occurrence data by comparing observed partial correlation coefficients between species to those estimated from regional species distributions. Extends Gaussian graphical models to a null modeling framework. Provides interface to a variety of inverse covariance matrix estimation methods.
