Title: Inference of Species Associations from Co-Occurrence Data
Version: 0.7.2
Date: 2026-01-18
Maintainer: Benjamin Blonder <benjamin.blonder@berkeley.edu>
Description: Infers species associations from community matrices. Uses local and (optional) regional-scale co-occurrence data by comparing observed partial correlation coefficients between species to those estimated from regional species distributions. Extends Gaussian graphical models to a null modeling framework. Provides interface to a variety of inverse covariance matrix estimation methods.
